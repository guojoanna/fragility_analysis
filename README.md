# Fragility Analysis
## By: Adam Li

This repository is housing the end to end fragility algorithm for epileptogenic zone localization as described by publications from the Neuromedical Control Systems Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University.

# Web Application
The main user interface will be through a web application that a user can upload data, and also visualize the predictions produced at the end.

The technologies utilized will be: Django for the web framework, or Node.js for the backend, React.JS for the front end, MongoDB for the database storage, and D3.js for data visualization.

# Algorithm Backend
Sitting at the core of the backend will be a parallelized fragility algorithm written in Python for fast run through of data uploaded by users.
